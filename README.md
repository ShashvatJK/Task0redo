> To code or not to code, is the question.

I'll just type out my favourite code :P
```
import javax.swing.*;

public class A{

    public JButton[][] createButtonGrid(int i1,int j1){

        JButton btn = new JButton();

        JButton btngrid[][] = new JButton[i1][j1];

        for(int i=0;i<i1;i++){

            for(int j=0;j<j1;j++){

                btngrid[i][j]=btn;

                btngrid[i][j].setVisible(true);

            }

        }

    }

}
```
